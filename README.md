## Introduction

* Tags: cultural analytics, artistic style, visual culture, quantifying culture
* Data: complete works (catalogue raisonne), digital images, bibliographic data
* Methods: image processing, feature extraction, clustering, visualization

Artists’ work is often described in terms of distinct phases clustering 
thematic and aesthetic approaches (for instance Picasso’s Blue Period), 
and art historians narrate the evolution of individual style (for 
instance Mondrian’s passage from representational landscapes to pure 
abstraction) to describe conceptual advancement in the field. 
Additionally, contemporary image processing and computer vision 
techniques provide a wealth of newly-available features describing
the content of images. Taking art as data, how can we use these 
feature extraction and analytic techniques to meaningfully describe,
quantify, and draw conclusions about the content of art works? 
This project starts with the analysis of historical works of fine 
art, with potential extension to broad categories of contemporary 
cultural image production. 

## Background

* [Data Science and Computational Art History](http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/087-data-science/manovich_digital_art_history.pdf), by Lev Manovich[http://manovich.net/], 2015. or [many other good papers](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/tag:Article).
* [American Type Painting](https://monoskop.org/images/c/ce/Greenberg_Clement_1955_1961_American-Type_Painting.pdf), by Clement Greenberg, 1955.
  
## Data

Many museums and cultural centers have digital collections of paintings and other work online. We will be working primarily with:
* Piet Mondrian's work in the [artnome database](https://knownwork.knack.com/artnome#artworks-piet-mondrian/) (Primary Source)
* Piet Mondrian's [Catalogue Raisonne](http://pietmondrian.rkdmonographs.nl/)
* [San Diego Museum of Art Collections](https://www.sdmart.org/collections/) 
  online collection for local museum, SDMA, possible alternate data set for
  project extension.
* [ArtStor](https://www.artstor.org/) large commercial art database available
  through UCSD.
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) contemporary visual social media.

### Possible Projects

* A comparative study of portraiture (head pose, gaze, and facial location within composition) in historic artist A and contemporary medium B.
* Quantifying Mark Rothko's work for instance visualizing compositional structure, color choice, price/cost at auction, etc.
* Understanding cities through their inhabitant’s social media posts (Instagram Cities by Manovich et al. http://phototrails.net/instagram-cities/)
* Extend your visualization to the VROOM tiled display or CAVE at QI.
* Apply similar cultural analytic methods to another creative domain (music, writing, etc.)
